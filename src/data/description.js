        <p>In this module we will define the <i>“Statement of Financial Position”</i> as an <span style={{color: '#111ee2'}}>entity’s assets, liabilities, and equities as of one day in time</span>, namely, the last day of the reporting period.  On a calendar year, that would be December 31.</p><br /><br />
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; We will come away with an understanding of the tangible and intangible assets of the entity, and the related liabilities that might have been incurred to obtain some of these assets.  We will look at the equities of the entity.  These have been called reserves or fund balances in the past.  Today they are called “net assets,” and include three different types of equities or net assets.</p><br />
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We will delve into the “<span style={{color: '#111ee2'}}>component parts</span>,” or sub-sections of each category.  For example, we will discuss by definition and by example, the different types of assets.  These are the:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>1.<span style={{color: '#111ee2'}}>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Current assets,</span></li>
          <li>2.<span style={{color: '#111ee2'}}>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fixed assets, and</span></li>
          <li>3.<span style={{color: '#111ee2'}}>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other assets</span></li>
        </ul><br />
        <p> Throughout, we will observe the <span style={{color: '#111ee2'}}>“interactions”</span> assets may have with liabilities, equities, cash flows, and revenues and expenses.  Although we are working with the statement of financial position, it is necessary to understand that all of these statements interact.  This interaction will prepare us for the additional modules of this course.</p><br />

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <span style={{color: '#111ee2'}}>Statement of Financial Position</span> is an integral part of the basic financial statements.  It is a required report if you are to have a complete set of financial statements.</p><br /><br />
        <p> The statement brings together the so-called <span style={{color: '#111ee2'}}>“ACCOUNTING EQUATION,”</span> which states that <span style={{color: '#111ee2'}}>“ASSETS” = “LIABILITIES + NET ASSETS,”</span> or equities, of an organization.  The report illustrates these real accounts as of the last day of the reporting period, usually the month, quarter, or fiscal year end date, such as December 31 for a calendar year-end organization.</p>

        <p>The <span style={{color: '#111ee2'}}>“Statement of Financial Position”</span> is one of the basic, required financial statements detailing an entity’s <span style={{color: '#111ee2'}}>ASSETS, LIABILITIES, and NET ASSETS</span> or equities as of one date in time, usually the last day of the reporting period.  Our sample financial statements will include a statement of financial position as of December 31, the last day of our presentation fiscal year.</p><br />
        <p>A <span style={{color: '#111ee2'}}>“for profit”</span> business would refer to this statement as the <span style={{color: '#111ee2'}}>“Balance Sheet.”</span>  Statement of financial position is nonprofit terminology.</p><br />
        <p>	The statement of financial position produces the <span style={{color: '#111ee2'}}>“accounting equation,” ASSETS  =  LIABILITIES  +  NET ASSETS or equities.</span></p>

        <p>•    It summarizes the organization on the <span style={{color: '#111ee2'}}>“whole,”</span> rather than by programs or funds.</p><br/>
        <p>•    It presents the types of <span style={{color: '#111ee2'}}>“net assets,”</span> so the user can easily distinguish the “unrestricted” funds from funds “committed” through “temporarily restricted” and “permanently restricted” sources of funds.</p><br/>
        <p>• The statement is in accordance with FASB – ASC No. 958, which establishes a financial reporting <span style={{color: '#111ee2'}}>based on “net assets,”</span> rather than on individual funds.</p>

        <p style={{color: '#111ee2'}}>Accounting Equation - </p><br/>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <span style={{color: '#111ee2'}}>“accounting equation”</span> has been around for a very long time.  The computation of the equation takes us back to algebra with its “math-like” notation, but what it tells us is that <span style={{color: '#111ee2'}}>ASSETS = LIABILITIES + NET ASSETS</span>. This is very logical in that if we have $1,000 in cash assets and we owe $300 to our landlord, our equity or “net assets” are equal to the difference or $700.  Granted, this is a simplistic explanation, but it drives home the concept that accounting for the assets and liabilities of an entity will yield its equity or deficit, if liabilities exceed assets. </p><br/>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will be working with a sample financial statement, which you can easily access.  Highlighted, you will see the equation at work with the assets totaling $2,038,138.  The balancing side of the equation is the sum of liabilities at $721,249 plus the equity or “net assets” of $1,316,889.  Combined, the liabilities and net assets = $2,038,138, the same amount as the assets of the entity.</p>
      </div>

    id: 10,

      <div>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <span style={{color: '#111ee2'}}><i>“accounting equation”</i></span> doesn’t get the same notoriety as some other equations we are familiar with, such as Pi, energy and mass, and, of course, the “quadratic equation,” but it does have its importance and application in business.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we have discussed, the <span style={{color: '#111ee2'}}><i>“accounting equation”</i></span> consists of an entity’s assets, liabilities, and equities.  Each of these classifications has sub-categories.  For instance, “ASSETS” contain “current assets,” “fixed assets,” and “other assets.”</p>
        <br/>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style={{color: '#111ee2'}}><i>“LIABILITIES”</i></span> are classified as those that are “current liabilities,” which are amounts due to be paid within the next 12 months, and often much sooner, such as 30 days, and <span style={{color: '#111ee2'}}><i>“LONG-TERM LIABILITIES,”</i></span> which are amounts due beyond 12 months, such as mortgages and multi-year notes or loans.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>Finally, we have an entity’s equities, which are referred to as “<span style={{color: '#111ee2'}}><i>NET ASSETS.</i></span>”  These are sub-classified as “unrestricted,” “temporarily restricted,” and “permanently restricted.”  We will discuss all of these in greater detail as we proceed through this presentation.</p>

        <p><span style={{color: '#111ee2'}}><i>“Current assets”</i></span>are considered to have several key attributes:</p><br/>
        <p>•      They are assets easily converted to cash</p>
        <p>•      This usually happens within a year</p>
        <p>•      A sale or exchange of inventories or services will prompt these transactions, and</p>
        <p>•     They are often called <span style={{color: '#111ee2'}}><i>“Liquid assets”</i></span></p><br/>
        <p><i>If we give a little thought to this, we can imagine any type of business offering its products or services in exchange for cash.  The hope is that cash collections would occur within a reasonable period of time, perhaps 30 days.  The definition of “current assets,” however, is that assets such as inventories and receivables will convert to cash within one year.  This may seem extreme for services already provided, but may be realistic for inventories held for sale, which may be on hand and available for sale, for many months.</i></p>
        <p><i>The term <span style={{color: '#111ee2'}}>“Liquid assets”</span></i>pertains to the types of assets classified as current – cash, CDs, grant and accounts receivable, investments, inventories – all assets that generally convert to cash within a reasonable period of time.  Since cash is considered the most <span style={{color: '#111ee2'}}><i>liquid</i></span> of assets, that expression is associated with current assets as they, too, convert to cash in normal business operations.</p>
        <p>We begin our review of the statement of financial position with current assets valued at $1,233,587 on December 31, the last day of the reporting period.</p>

        <p>Cash and cash equivalents consist of money on hand, bank deposit accounts, savings accounts, and petty cash.  It may include certificates of deposit if there are no early withdrawal restrictions.  Some accounts may generate interest income for the organization.  Cash is an organization’s ability to procure goods and services, pay its debts, and expand and modernize.  Within a nonprofit setting, cash may be provided by grantors to be used in accordance with grant provisions.</p>
        <br/><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash is <span style={{color: '#111ee2'}}>the most liquid of assets</span> and, without proper security controls, may be easily manipulated or stolen.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an important <span style={{color: '#111ee2'}}><i>“Key Observation”</i></span> because accounting principles are guiding us to reflect the current <span style={{color: '#111ee2'}}><i>“fair market value”</i> or FMV</span> of the marketable securities on the last day of the reporting period.</p>
        <br/><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In this particular example, we see that securities costing us $367,236 are now worth $449,516 as of the reporting date.<br/></p>
        <p>Therefore, we have incurred <span style={{color: '#111ee2'}}>an <i>“unrealized”</i></span> gain of $82,280. An <span style={{color: '#111ee2'}}><i>“unrealized”</i></span> gain or loss is calculable while we continue to own the securities.  It can change in amount from day-to-day as market prices of the portfolio change.  It becomes a “realized” gain or loss upon the liquidation or sale of the securities for cash.</p>

        <p style={{color: '#111ee2'}}>Endowment Investments<br />(continued)</p><br />
        <p>I now want to take our example in a different direction.  Our sample organization has experienced an appreciation of the portfolio balance as of the end of the reporting period, as illustrated in the previous slide.  I want to introduce you to the consequences of an <span style={{color: '#111ee2'}}>underperforming portfolio</span> that has lost value.</p>
        <br /><p>Let us assume a donor has contributed $500,000 in cash with the proviso that the organization maintain the proceeds in perpetuity and only the annual income earned can be distributed.  The organization makes the decision to invest the money in a portfolio of marketable securities.</p>
        <br /><p> The portfolio has a FMV of $449,516 at the fiscal end reporting date causing an <span style={{color: '#111ee2'}}>“unrealized” loss of $50,484 ($500,000 less $449,516).</span>  Repercussions exist as the donation amount of $500,000 has lost $50,484 in value.  The organization <span style={{color: '#111ee2'}}>failed to maintain the “principal” balance</span> of the contribution as stipulated by the grantor.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The management of the organization has a responsibility to:</p>
        <p style={{color: '#111ee2'}}>• Maintain the principal of the endowment,</p>
        <p style={{color: '#111ee2'}}>• Invest prudently, and</p>
        <p style={{color: '#111ee2'}}>• Use unrestricted funds to cover shortfalls in the endowment.</p>

        <p style={{color: '#111ee2'}}>Endowment Investments<br />(continued)</p><br />
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The “unrestricted net assets” must allocate $50,484 of its equity balance to the permanently restricted net assets as of the period end date.  They are required to transfer any amount necessary to <span style={{color: '#111ee2'}}>cover the shortfall</span> until the portfolio is able to regain its original principal amount of $500,000.  The effect is that funds normally available without restriction for use by the organization are no longer available for general use.  If in the following year the portfolio recovers to above the $500,000 level, the restriction on “unrestricted net assets” would be released and the funds would be returned to the unrestricted category.</p><br/>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style={{color: '#111ee2'}}>Failure to maintain the original principal balance</span> of contributions will result in the allocation of “unrestricted net assets” to “permanently restricted net assets,” until the contribution amounts are fully recovered.</p>

        <p><span style={{color: '#111ee2'}}>Accounts receivable</span> are often referred to as “trade receivables.” They represent amounts owed to the organization for goods and or services provided by the organization through <span style={{color: '#111ee2'}}>“arm’s length” transactions.</span></p>
        <br/><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount still owed on the last day of the reporting period would be the “accounts receivable.”  In this case, the organization would be owed $16,478 by its clients.</p>
        <br/><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The organization would have earned income upon completion of the sale of goods or services to its clients.  GAAP accounting recognizes income as earned, regardless of when the amount is received.</p>
        <br/><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, suppose a social service organization provides training sessions to health care professionals.  Its income would be earned on a fee for service basis.  The organization is, in effect, extending credit to its clients.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an asset account.  Specific parties have promised to contribute a specified amount to an organization.  More commonly they are referred to as <span style={{color: '#111ee2'}}><i>“pledges receivable.”</i></span></p>
        <br/><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Usually these are general pledges that require no conditions or restrictions being placed upon the recipient organization.</p>
        <br/><p>They may or may not be <i>“enforceable”</i> by the collecting organization as few organizations would seek legal means to collect the pledge due to related costs of collection and the potential image problem associated with overly aggressive collections.</p>
        <p>An <span style={{color: '#111ee2'}}><i>“allowance for uncollectible pledges”</i></span> should be established for those deemed to be uncollectible or a percentage could be designated as uncollectible based upon previous experiences.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Organizations may maintain products that they resell such as books and audio programs.  They may manufacture these in-house or purchase a finished product to be re-sold to its customers with an appropriate mark-up of selling price.  They appear on the statement of financial position valued at the <span style={{color: '#111ee2'}}>“lower of cost or market” or LCM.</span>  Products in this category are considered to be assets until such time as they are sold to customers or are considered to be obsolete or out-dated.  They are then removed from the inventory asset classification.</p><br/>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our example for this type of asset would be an organization that purchases its inventory, adds a markup, and then sells the product to the ultimate consumer.  They are not involved in the manufacture of component parts to create the inventory product.  In essence, they are re-sellers.</p><br/>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Are sample company provides training to health care professionals.  Training is done by fee for service seminars or through the seminars being packaged and sold as books and audio programs.

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Some assets are acquired during one fiscal year, but they provide benefits into the next fiscal year or longer.  Such assets are allocated among the applicable periods of coverage.</p><br/>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;An <span style={{color: '#111ee2'}}>example of prepaid assets is “Prepaid Insurance.”</span>  Insurance policies are usually purchased and paid for in advance of coverage, often for one year terms.  A policy purchased on April 1 and effective from April 1 of the current year to next April 1 is prorated to determined the prepaid or unexpired portion and the expired, expensed portion.  A policy costs $1,200 would be wholly prepaid as of the first April 1.  Each month, $100 of usage is charged as an expense while the prepaid insurance account is reduced by the same amount.  As of December 31, nine months of usage would have occurred with just three months of unexpired or prepaid insurance remaining.  The prepaid insurance asset balance at December 31 would be $300.  The expense for the year would be $900 or $100 of monthly usage for nine months.</p>

        <p style={{color: '#111ee2'}}>Prepaid assets (continued)</p><br />
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key observation is that generally accepted accounting principles, “GAAP,” require the <span style={{color: '#111ee2'}}>pro-ration of the unexpired insurance and the expensed or expired insurance.</span>  Assume two fiscal years, YEAR 1 and YEAR 2, with the payment made on April 1, YEAR 1, for the 12 months ending April 1, YEAR 2.  On a cash basis method of accounting, which is not GAAP approved, YEAR 1 would have an expense of $1,200 while YEAR 2 would have no expense.  Under the accrual basis of accounting, which is GAAP approved, you would have a pro-rated expense of $900 in YEAR 1 for the nine months, and $300 of expense in YEAR 2.</p><br/>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may argue that the policy would renew in YEAR 2 with approximately the same premium amount and that under the non-GAAP cash basis of accounting, each year would have an expense of approximately $1,200.  On a monthly or quarterly reporting period as opposed to an annual report, the cash basis method would truly be misleading.  The accrual or GAAP method, however, would always reflect a cost of $100 per month with an unexpired or prepaid asset balance reducing by the same amount each month.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audited financial statements are usually done on a GAAP basis, and it is for this reason that we pro-rate prepaid assets.</p>

We will talk about depreciation expense in a little while, but <span style={{color: '#111ee2'}}>land is not subject to depreciation.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Next we will look at an example to illustrate the recording of the land at cost.  Assume that you enter into a contract to purchase the land for a building site for $160,000.  The related settlement costs total $7,451.  Therefore, the land account in the accounting records will reflect a total land cost of $167,451.  The cost basis of accounting is the generally accepted method of recognizing fixed asset balances.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style={{color: '#111ee2'}}>Buildings</span> may include any structures owned by the organization, which may include the office site and other space used in the operation of the organization.</p><br/>
        <p>The building <span style={{color: '#111ee2'}}>is recorded at the purchase price plus any settlement costs and additional costs to get the building in an operable condition.</span>  The building account balance <span style={{color: '#111ee2'}}>does not reflect any appreciation in value due to rising market prices.</span>  Appreciation is only recognized upon the subsequent sale of the property, at which time a capital gain would be recognized as a form of other income.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Buildings are depreciated over their estimated useful lives, which could be in excess of 40 years.</p>
        <br/><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Depreciation is a systematic approach to allocating the cost of a fixed asset over the estimated useful life of that asset.  For example, a building with a cost of $564,119 (purchase price of $550,000 plus settlement costs of $14,119) and an estimated useful life of 40 years would allocate 1/40 of that cost or $14,103 as depreciation expense in each of the 40 years.  It would be misleading to expense $564,119 in year one and nothing in the remaining 39 years of service life.  Therefore, we “capitalize” the asset acquisition cost as a fixed asset rather than an expense and allocate it evenly over the expected asset life.</p><br/>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us assume the building has appreciated in value during the few years we have owned it.  Our initial cost was the $564,119, but today it is worth $625,000 according to local appraisers.  We would continue to recognize in the financial statements the cost basis or $564,119 as the accounting valuation of this property.  The appreciated value would not be taken into consideration until the eventual sale of the building.</p><br/>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In a few minutes we will discuss impairments to long-lived assets where the market value is less than the carrying value of the asset and the lower valuation is expected to be permanent.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style={{color: '#111ee2'}}>Building improvements</span> are also recorded at cost.  They represent major betterments to the infrastructure of a building.  These betterments enjoy multi-year service lives as they are tangible and are expected to provide benefits to the organization for an extended period of time.  It is for these reasons that improvements are capitalized as fixed assets and depreciated annually over their estimated useful lives.</p><br/>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Building improvements may include <span style={{color: '#111ee2'}}>major additions</span>, such as an add-on to the existing structure, which would add needed square footage for office space, classrooms, or storage areas.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Building improvements may include sprinkler systems, which may be required by changes in local building codes.  HVAC or heating and air conditioning systems being installed as new or as replacements will enhance the use of the building over many years.  Periodically, a roof may need to be replaced.  These are major expenditures that do aid multiple years and are, therefore, capitalized and depreciated over their useful lives.</p><br/>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, <span style={{color: '#111ee2'}}>major repairs that enhance or extend the service life</span> of a building are recorded as fixed assets.  Accounting recognizes that organizations have different sizes of operating budgets and accounting “materiality.”  It is common practice to designate a <span style={{color: '#111ee2'}}>“capitalization” policy.</span>  By this, I mean a dollar amount to determine whether an expenditure is a current year expense or should be capitalized and illustrated as a fixed asset.</p><br/>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Routinely, for my small nonprofit clients, We discuss this matter and many will often designate that equipment or repair type expenditures of $1,000 or more will be considered to be fixed assets, while disbursements less than $1,000 will period expenses.  This is a two-fold process in that the expenditure must meet the criteria of extending the asset life beyond the current year.  Secondly, disbursements of less than $1,000, if combined in the pursuit of a collective project exceed $1,000, then they should be viewed in total and properly classified as a fixed asset.</p><br/>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;An example would be the purchase of component parts for an IT system.  Individually, no component costs more than $1,000.  Collectively, however, the combined cost to establish an IT department is $4,500.  This type of effort should be capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the equipment.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The best way to understand “accumulated depreciation” is to present an example.  Please keep in mind that the fixed asset “Land” is not depreciable.  Therefore, the remaining tangible assets - building, improvements, machinery & equipment, and vehicles, are the assets to be depreciated each period.  The total to be depreciated is $895,459 ( the sub-total of $1,062,910 less land of $167,451 ).</p>

        <p>Finally, let’s talk about an <span style={{color: '#111ee2'}}><i>“impairment”</i></span> to asset valuation.  This exists where the current market valuation of a fixed asset is less than the “carrying amount,” of that asset, and the difference is expected to be <span style={{color: '#111ee2'}}>permanent</span>.  The <span style={{color: '#111ee2'}}><i>“carrying amount”</i> is the original cost basis of the asset less any accumulated depreciation to date.</span>  Another expression is “net book value,” or NBV.  Assume it is learned that the adjoining building is to be demolished with the site planned to be used as a parking lot.  This is viewed as a negative development within the community and neighboring properties are losing value.</p>
